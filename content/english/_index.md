  description: "KEEB Group seeks to develop hands-free tools for the purpose of 24/7 use to make permanent solutions accessible to individuals who need to watch their oxygen saturation values."
  content: "KEEB Group's mission is to create devices that enhance the ability of people to prevent hypoxemic episodes. By developing comfortable devices that use specialized algorithms to map out hypoxemic episodes, patients can prevent hypoxemic episodes through awareness and react quickly when oxygen saturation drops below the line of safety."

  title: "VISION"
  content: " By making unobtrusive, affordable, reusable SpO2 monitoring available to patients, we seek to mitigate the effects of hypoxemia, allowing those with conditions such as Long COVID and COPD to continue doing the things they love with the people they love.


  Similar to the way someone with diabetes must optimize their blood-glucose levels, there are underserved individuals who would benefit from the freedom and comfort of devices made for constant use. Most modern solutions, such as the monitor pictured here, aren't effective. They're not comfortable, they're obtrusive, and they take away your freedom of movement.


  Our products are designed specifically to make sure you do not compromise on dexterity, accuracy, or independence, while providing an affordable and consistent price.
