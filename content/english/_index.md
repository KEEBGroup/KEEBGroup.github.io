  description: "KEEB Group seeks to develop hands-free tools for the purpose of 24/7 use to make permanent solutions accessible to individuals who need to watch their oxygen saturation values."
  content: "KEEB Group's mission is to create devices that enhance the ability of people to prevent hypoxemic episodes. By developing comfortable devices that use specialized algorithms to map out hypoxemic episodes, patients can prevent hypoxemic episodes through awareness and react quickly when oxygen saturation drops below the line of safety."

  title: "VISION"
  content: " By making unobtrusive, affordable, reusable SpO2 monitoring available to patients, we seek to mitigate the effects of hypoxemia, allowing those with conditions such as Long COVID and COPD to continue doing the things they love with the people they love.


  Similar to the way someone with diabetes must optimize their blood-glucose levels, there are underserved individuals who would benefit from the freedom and comfort of devices made for constant use. Most modern solutions, such as the monitor pictured here, aren't effective. They're not comfortable, they're obtrusive, and they take away your freedom of movement.


  Our products are designed specifically to make sure you do not compromise on dexterity, accuracy, or independence, while providing an affordable and consistent price.

    content: "I have been relying on the health app on my phone. Readings are so delayed when I am short of breath, I feel like it doesn't capture my lows. It will have me wait a LONG time 'check that your finger is on the sensor' if my fingers are cold."

    content: "I also have an Apple watch that has the SpO2 feature. But, I have noticed that although it is pretty accurate, it is not easy to get a reading on demand. Many times I have to retry 3 or 4 times before it will register a reading. The monitor is extremely sensitive to placement on your wrist and tightness of the band."

    content: "I was watching the O2 ring for a long time waiting for a deal. I got a good price during a lightening deal. I thought that would be best, but it's hard to see. The good thing is you can set alerts. It will buzz or vibe if you go below what you set it for. (I wanted to also see my overnight oxygen)

Takes time to get used to wearing this. Honestly, I don't use it too often. But it's a more discreet way of checking & if I can't see due to sun, I just open the app on my phone & it's in sync."
