### KEEB Group: SPO2 Monitoring made Affordable!

We understand the challenges faced by individuals with disorders and illnesses that result in hypoxemia. 

To support better health management, we are proud to introduce our innovative SpO2 monitoring device. This affordable and cutting-edge device continuously monitors blood oxygen levels, providing real-time data to warn and support individuals in receiving oxygen as soon as possible. By offering a non-invasive and reliable way to track oxygen saturation, our SpO2 sensor empowers you to manage your condition more effectively and stay on top of your respiratory health. 

#### 1. RES Device

Sleep soundly at night with the RES Device.

#### 2. What data do you collect? Can I connect it with my doctor's app?

We store no data on our servers about you or what you do. 

All of our data is currently stored in our app, and is not transmitted to anyone. In the future, we will design a system that integrates with modern telehealth systems to provide this information to your health provider with your consent.

<!-- #### 3. Is this a medical device?

No. It is a wellness and self diagnostic device. Our devices pose a low risk to the safety of the user and others, and are not intended to diagnose or treat a specific disease. They are not currently designed to withstand natural disasters, geopolitical issues, and we do not make medical claims to any. We plan to file for a Class 1 medical device label after we develop a minimum viable product and can prove that our device matches or exceeds the efficiency and accuracy of competing devices. -->
